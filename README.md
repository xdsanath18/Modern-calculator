# 🖩 Simple Calculator (Python)
---
## 📖 Project Description
The Simple Calculator is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to perform basic arithmetic operations.
It is built with clean and easy-to-read code, making it an excellent starting point for anyone learning Python.
This calculator allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers, while also handling errors such as invalid inputs and division by zero.
It runs in a looped menu system, so users can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
